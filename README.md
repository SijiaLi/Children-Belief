# Children Belief

This project is based on a behavior study on children aging between 5 and 10 across Turkey & US, aiming to find the pattern in children’s belief on certain topics. 
From the data we’re curious to find out: 
* Are there any differences between the countries? 
* Are there age difference? 
* Are there patterns in which essentialization scores decrease by age similar in both countries, or are there different patterns in the two countries on how much a certain category is essentialized?
